Add tutorials and notebooks here.

Tutorials are presented in collections, but refrain from adding numbers to the
filename so we can move things around if needed. Notebooks are docs, docs are
notebooks. The filename is the URL. Let's use the format:
`/tutorials/collection-name/an-example-model.ipynb`
